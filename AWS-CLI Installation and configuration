Before writing the playbook and if you wish to automate something in AWS using Ansible, you have to install AWS-CLI and configure AWS. Below are the steps for same.

$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

$ python get-pip.py --user

1.Use the curl command to download the installation script. The following command uses the -O (uppercase "O") parameter to specify that the downloaded file is to be stored in the current folder using the same name it has on the remote host.


$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
Or

$ sudo yum install epel-release

$ sudo yum install python-pip

$ pip --version

Run the script with Python to download and install the latest version of pip and other required support packages.

$ python get-pip.py –user

Or

python3 get-pip.py –user (When you include the --user switch, the script installs pip to the path ~/.local/bin.) 

Ensure the folder that contains pip is part of your PATH variable.

Now you can test to verify that pip is installed correctly.

$ pip3 --version

Use pip to install the AWS CLI.

$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade –user

When you use the --user switch, pip installs the AWS CLI to ~/.local/bin. Verify that the AWS CLI installed correctly.

$ aws –version

Upgrading to the Latest Version of the AWS CLI version 1

$ pip3 install --upgrade --user awscli

Configuring AWS

$ aws configure     # Provide aws_security_key and aws_access_key to configure

$ pip install boto --user    # you require boto package to create instances, security groups, VPN creations and many more

Installing Ansible

$ yum install epel-release

$ yum install ansible
