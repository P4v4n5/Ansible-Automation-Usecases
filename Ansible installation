Step 1: Update the System
Update the system with the latest packages and security patches using these commands.

sudo yum -y update

Step 2: Install EPEL Repository
EPEL or Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux repository is a free and community based repository which provide many extra open source software packages which are not available in default YUM repository.

We need to install EPEL repository into the system as Ansible is available in default YUM repository is very old.

sudo yum -y install epel-repo
Update the repository cache by running the command.

sudo yum -y update

Step 3: Install Ansible
Run the following command to install the latest version of Ansible.

sudo yum -y install ansible
You can check if Ansible is installed successfully by finding its version.

ansible --version
You should see a similar output.

[sneluser@host ~]$ ansible --versionansible 2.7.10  config file = None  configured module search path = [u'/home/sneluser/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible  python version = 2.7.5 (default, Apr  9 2019, 14:30:50) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36)]
